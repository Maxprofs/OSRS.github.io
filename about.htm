            <p class="lead">OSRS is an acronym for "Open Science, Engineering, Research and Development Systems". The acronym OSRS has been around with our group since at least 2008 as a simple name to distinguish our focus from pure production. The OSRS name is not a company brand, but instead a declaration of our primary area of focus.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row featurette">
            <h2 class="featurette-heading">About</h2>
            <p class="lead">OSRS Open is an independent organization to foster open development and collaboration focused on the transition of new technologies to the enterprise as well as to emphasize research and development of new technologies. We serve as a forum for developers to enhance their understanding of the possibilities available in technology, while always pushing toward the horizon.</p>
            <p class="lead">As the OSRS name implies, we focus initially on engineering and the sciences with the intent to bridge the gap between technical and enterprise computing.</p>
			<h3>What is OSRS Open</h3>
			<p class="lead">OSRS Open is a non-profit group that operates at a <it>Net Zero Income</it> to provide an established framework for intellectual property that limits potential legal exposure for our project committers and ensures indefinite availability of all contributions to the broader community. Through our meritocratic process, all members are able to collaborate to develop and transition high quality software from R&D stages to enterprise production.</p>
            <h3>What we provide</h3>
            <p class="lead">We host and steward open source code, open data specifications and bring agencies together to share data, practices and of course code. More specifically, we focus on advanced capabilities aimed at shaping the future of computing, not just the "cool stuff", but foundational capabilities and techniques. The OSRS Open board takes input from the community to shape priorities for future development efforts and champions the adoption of other software into the OSRS Open community.</p>
			<h3>How does OSRS Open Operate</h3>
			<p class="lead">All members of the OSRS Open organization have a say in operations via voting for members of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors is made of members from various organizations and individuals from our community. A large part of our operational model is adapted from the <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/">Apache ASF</a>, with differences primarily related to our focus on R&D and computing futures.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Philosophy</h2>
            <p class="lead">We have a simple guiding principle: work with great people to do great things with no ego, while expecting that failure is the first step to learning. We believe:<ul>
				<li>Shared ideas, technology and open communication are a key way to inspire innovation.</li>
				<li>Innovation isn't just incremental improvement, its the combination of evolution and revolution.</li>
				<li>Always aim for the horizon, always remember you can never reach it, so always adapt to the new horizon ahead of you.</li>
				<li>Just because something is popular doesn't mean its good, but it may also not be too bad. You have to look at it to know the difference.</li>
				<li>Many things are popular because they are new and hype is about the financial possibilities, not the intrinsic value.</li>
				<li>Don't focus on financial aspects of technology, but expect it will be important to others, that is neither good nor bad, just a reality.</li>
				<li>Even though communities overlap, they often will not communicate or understand the synergies they can achieve. Above all, we want to help bridge that gap.</li>
				<li>Great technology is useless if it isn't used.</li>
				<li>Let others use the tools and techniques they prefer, bring your own process (BYOP).</li>
			</ul></p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Services</h2>
            <p class="lead">We primarily steward the intellectual property of the technologies and source code artifacts produced by our community members. We also however...<ul>
				<li>Facilitate Rapid Innovation Teams (RITs) lifecycles to investigate and quickly research and prototype new technologies.</li>
				<li>Find and manage hosting for data services on behalf of our members.</li>
				<li>Facilitate meetings for business process improvement, technology assessments, requirements and data modeling sessions.</li>
				<li>Help our members connect to each other to find capable staff to build new things.</li>
				<li>Help our members identify and connect to initiate cost-sharing for common development.</li>
				<li>Connect communities to each other by facilitating meeting and discussion opportunities.</li>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Membership</h2>
            <p class="lead">Membership in OSRS Open comes in two general flavors, contributors and board membership. Contributors are any organization or individual that provides content to OSRS Open projects under our contribution terms.</p>
			<p class="lead">Contributors provide content in the form of code, documentation, bug or feature analyses. Contributors that provide code directly are considered "committers" and are provided access to our source code repositories.</p>
            <h3 class="featurette-heading">Become a Committer</h3>
			<p class="lead">We welcome all potential committers that want to give back to our projects. OSRS Open is a meritocracy and not profit/commercially driven. That is to say that all of our works are driven by the people and organizations that commit to our code and our code is evolving to solve real world problems better. The more anyone contributes, the more access and responsibility they are given.</p>
			<p class="lead">Start off by using our code base and providing feedback on our content on <a href="https://github.com/OSRS/OsrsHome">github</a>. If you find areas where you or your organization can contribute, start the discussion with us to determine how to both implement code that fits with our architectures and how to ensure any code contributions will be compatible with our liberal licensing requirements.</p>
            <p class="lead">If this is a good fit, you'll be a key contributor in no time. But even if you just want to use our code, you can still contribute by donating time to our open issues, or you can still sponsor us.</p>
